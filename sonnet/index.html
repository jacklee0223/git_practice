The Scarlet Plague - Jack London
</h1>

<p>The Scarlet Plague is a post-apocalyptic fiction novel written by Jack London and originally published in London Magazine in 1912.
</p>

<p>The story takes place in 2073, sixty years after an uncontrollable epidemic, the Red Death,[1] has depopulated the planet. James Howard Smith is one of the few survivors of the pre-plague era left alive in the San Francisco area, and as he realizes his time grows short, he tries to impart the value of knowledge and wisdom to his grandsons. But his efforts are in vain, for they live the primeval life of hunters-gatherers and ridicule his recollections of the past, which sound totally unbelievable to them.

<p>The old man peered from under his green leaf at the danger, and stood as  quietly as the boy. For a few seconds this mutual scrutinizing went  on; then, the bear betraying a growing irritability, the boy, with a  movement of his head, indicated that the old man must step aside from  the trail and go down the embankment. The boy followed, going backward,  still holding the bow taut and ready. They waited till a crashing among  the bushes from the opposite side of the embankment told them the bear  had gone on. The boy grinned as he led back to the trail.</p>

<p>"A big un, Granser," he chuckled.</p>

<p>The old man shook his head.</p>

<p>"They get thicker every day," he complained in a thin, undependable  falsetto. "Who'd have thought I'd live to see the time when a man would  be afraid of his life on the way to the Cliff House. When I was a boy,  Edwin, men and women and little babies used to come out here from San  Francisco by tens of thousands on a nice day. And there weren't any  bears then. No, sir. They used to pay money to look at them in cages,  they were that rare."</p>

<p>"What is money, Granser?"</p>

<p>Before the old man could answer, the boy recollected and triumphantly  shoved his hand into a pouch under his bear-skin and pulled forth a  battered and tarnished silver dollar. The old man's eyes glistened, as  he held the coin close to them.</p>

<p>"I can't see," he muttered. "You look and see if you can make out the  date, Edwin."</p>

<p>The boy laughed.</p>

<p>"You're a great Granser," he cried delightedly, "always making believe  them little marks mean something."</p>

<p>The old man manifested an accustomed chagrin as he brought the coin back  again close to his own eyes.</p>
